    <h3 class="raleway">Lopop. Mobile app to connect local buyer and seller for trading stuffs</h3>
    <p class="lead">Lopop is a location-based marketplace app that aims to help students deal with they used items. It has a similar UI as amazon or eBay. The difference is that buyers are able to chat with seller directly though in-app chatting or whatever methods they want. They will also discuss and come up with an agreement about the price, how or where to trade etc.</p>
	<p class="lead">I was developing this together with my college friend <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/troyling">Troy Ling</a>. However we had to stop the project in late 2015 because the server we where using, Parse, stopped its service and transformed to an open source software, and we cannot host the server. Also, Facebook redesigned its Marketplace in late 2016 that allows the same thing that we are creating, with all its existing users.</p>
